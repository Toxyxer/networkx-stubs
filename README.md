# networkx-stubs

This is a heavily WIP/experimental `-stub` package as specified in [PEP 561](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0561/#stub-only-packages).

Currently I only aim to cover basic `DiGraph` functionality, which I require for another project, but I am happy to accept any PRs that covers other usecases/interfaces.

In some cases the annotations are [outright wrong](https://github.com/fmagin/networkx-stubs/blob/master/networkx-stubs/algorithms/operators/binary.pyi#L21) and require further thought be extended to all uses cases. If you find any other examples that are not annotated, please open an issue or submit a PR.
